> **This is the Navree skeleton.** It is the app that `navree new` writes, kept in step with every release of Navree. Press "Use this template" on GitHub, or run `navree new <name>` yourself and get the same files under your own name (`cargo install navree-cli` installs the command).

# Skeleton

A Navree app: a Rust API with modules,
dependency injection, JWT authentication, roles and abilities, migrations,
queues and OpenAPI docs.

Its screens are drawn on the server with Navree UI: sign-in with two-factor
authentication, workspaces you can switch between, a customers table with
search, filters and sort, forms, a page for each customer, and a home page
whose figures stay current. There is no front-end project to build.

## Getting started

You need Docker or Podman: `navree dock up` runs the database (TimescaleDB,
PostgreSQL with time-series hypertables) in a container, as `dock.toml`
describes.

```sh
cp .env.example .env
navree dock up               # the database on 127.0.0.1:5432; `navree dock down` stops it
navree dev                   # build, serve on http://127.0.0.1:8080, rebuild on save
```

Then open http://127.0.0.1:8080 and sign in with `harpreet.singh@example.com` and the
password `demo-password-2026`. The account and forty demo customers are made
when the app starts. That happens in development and in tests, never when `env`
is `production`: a deployed app has none of them. The API reference is at
http://127.0.0.1:8080/api/docs.

## Commands

| Command | What it does |
|---|---|
| `navree dev` | Serves the app and restarts it when the code changes |
| `navree make:module <name> --crud` | Adds a feature module under `src/modules/` |
| `navree make:<kind> <module> <name>` | Adds a controller, service, entity, migration, job, event, listener, mail, notification, policy, command, test, factory or seeder to a module |
| `navree make:model <module> <Name> --all` | Adds an ORM model with its migration, factory, seeder, JSON controller and policy |
| `navree model:show <Model>` | Shows a registered model: table, columns, casts, relationships, scopes, hooks, policy |
| `navree migrate`, `navree migrate:fresh --seed` | Runs the migrations of every module |
| `navree routes` | Lists every route with its access rule |
| `navree check --graph` | Validates the module graph |
| `navree queue:work` | Runs queued jobs |
| `navree list` | Lists every command of the app (`navree --help` lists the CLI's own) |

The CLI keeps a few commands for itself: `new`, `make:*`, `dev`, `check`, `gate`,
`dock`, `dock:add`, `dock:remove`, Harbor's commands (`deploy`, `deploy:rollback`,
`deploy:releases`, `build:image` and `harbor:*`), `mcp`, `skills:install`,
`browser:install` and `openapi:client`. Every other command runs in the app binary
(`cargo run -- <command>`), so production servers only need that binary.

## Layout

```text
config/app.toml        settings (.env and APP_* environment variables override them)
dock.toml              the local services `navree dock up` runs
src/app.rs             the root module: every module, configured once
src/abilities.rs       what each user may do
src/ui/                the shell, who is signed in (auth.rs), the live topic and formats
src/modules/customers/ the example feature: table, forms, pages, demo data
src/modules/<name>/    feature modules (mod.rs, controller.rs, service.rs,
                       entity.rs, dto.rs, migrations/, tests/)
tests/                 tests that boot the whole app
AGENTS.md              conventions for coding agents (CLAUDE.md imports it)
```

## The screens

| Address | Shows |
|---|---|
| `/` | figures that update when a customer changes, and the newest customers |
| `/customers` | a table: search, filters, sort and pages, all in the address (`?search=ludhiana&filter[city][in]=Ludhiana,Amritsar&sort=-monthly_paise`) |
| `/customers/new`, `/customers/{id}/edit` | the form that adds and edits a customer; mistakes appear under the fields |
| `/customers/{id}` | one customer |
| `/sign-in`, `/profile` | sign in (`?next=` is where to go afterwards), and who is signed in |
| `/account/two-factor` | sets up two-factor authentication with an authenticator app |

A page is a handler that takes the `Desk` extractor and returns the page it
builds; see `src/modules/customers/pages.rs`. Search, sort, filters and pages in
the address are the one list query every Navree list reads.

## How sign-in works

`AuthPages` (registered in `src/app.rs`) draws the sign-in, two-factor,
forgotten password and reset pages and signs out, on the session cookie, with
the throttle, two-factor authentication and the audit trail of `AuthModule`.
`src/ui/auth.rs` gives the pages `CurrentAccount`, who is signed in. To mail a
sign-in link or a code, or to sign in with a passkey, turn on
`auth.magic_link.enabled`, `auth.otp.enabled` or `auth.passkeys.enabled`: the
pages add the way in.

Public sign-up is off (`auth.registration` in `config/app.toml`). Accounts
exist because the seeder made the demo account, or because you make them.

## Workspaces

The demo account owns two workspaces, the Ludhiana desk and the Jalandhar desk,
each with its own customers. The switcher beside every page heading changes the
workspace; the customers table, the figures and the live updates are the
workspace's own.

## Live updates

The app's live hub (`RealtimeModule`) serves `GET /broadcasting/stream`. The
customers service nudges the workspace's `customers` topic after a change
commits, and every open table and figure of that workspace fetches itself
again. Open two windows to see it.

## Tests

```sh
cargo test
```

Each test gets a fresh SQLite database, so tests need no server. The same
migrations run there: hypertables become regular tables with the same keys
and indexes.
