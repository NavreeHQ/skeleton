# AGENTS.md

Instructions for coding agents working on Skeleton, a Navree app: a Rust
backend built from modules wired by dependency injection. Read this file
before changing code.

## Layout

```text
config/app.toml        settings shared by every environment (committed)
.env                   this machine's secrets, such as APP_KEY (never committed)
dock.toml              the local services (the database) `navree dock up` runs
src/main.rs            runs the app: `serve` by default, or any other command
src/app.rs             the root module: every module, configured once
src/abilities.rs       who may do what: permissions and ability rules
src/ui/                the screens' shell and `Desk` extractor (shell.rs), who is signed
                       in (auth.rs), the live topic (live.rs) and formats (rupees,
                       phone numbers, days)
src/modules/customers/ the example feature drawn with Navree UI: table.rs,
                       form.rs, pages.rs, home.rs, seed.rs
src/modules/<name>/    feature modules: mod.rs, controller.rs, service.rs,
                       entity.rs, dto.rs, migrations/, tests/
tests/                 tests that boot the whole app
tests/journey.rs       a visitor's whole way through the screens, over HTTP
storage/               runtime data: logs, uploads
```

## Commands

```sh
navree dock up                              # start the database (see dock.toml) first
navree dev                                  # serve on http://127.0.0.1:8080, rebuild on save
cargo test                                  # every test; each gets its own SQLite database
cargo clippy --all-targets -- -D warnings   # must pass
cargo fmt                                   # must leave nothing to change
navree check                                # validate the module graph without booting
navree routes                               # every route with its access rule
navree migrate                              # run pending migrations
navree list                                 # every command of the app
```

`navree <command>` runs `cargo run --quiet -- <command>` here. The API
reference is served at http://127.0.0.1:8080/api/docs while `navree dev`
runs.

## Generate code, then fill it in

Use the generators instead of writing files by hand: they follow the
conventions below and register what they create at the marker comments
`// navree:modules` (src/app.rs), `// navree:wire` (a module's `wire`) and
`// navree:policies` (src/abilities.rs). Keep those markers. Names are
snake_case; module names are plural. Generators never overwrite a file.

| To add | Run |
|---|---|
| A feature module with a CRUD JSON API, entity, migration and tests | `navree make:module posts --crud` |
| A controller in a module | `navree make:controller posts admin` |
| A service | `navree make:service posts pricing` |
| An entity, then its table | `navree make:entity posts tag`, then `navree make:migration posts create_tags_table` |
| An ORM model with its migration, factory, seeder, JSON controller and policy | `navree make:model posts Comment --all` (or any of `--migration --factory --seeder --controller --policy`); a many-to-many table: `navree make:model posts post_tag --pivot --all` |
| A model factory, a seeder | `navree make:factory posts pinned_comment --model comment`, `navree make:seeder posts demo_posts` |
| A migration | `navree make:migration posts add_slug_to_posts` |
| A queued job | `navree make:job posts publish_post` |
| An event and a listener | `navree make:event posts post_published`, then `navree make:listener posts notify_followers --event post_published` |
| A mail (HTML and text templates) | `navree make:mail posts welcome` |
| A notification | `navree make:notification posts post_liked` |
| Ability rules | `navree make:policy posts moderation` |
| A console command | `navree make:command posts publish_scheduled` |
| A test | `navree make:test posts publishing` |

## Conventions

- **Deny by default.** Every route declares who may call it with
  `#[public]`, `#[authenticated]`, `#[roles(..)]`, `#[permissions(..)]` or
  `#[can(Action, Subject)]` (`from = "id"` checks the record in the path).
  A route without one does not compile. Never make a route `#[public]` to
  get past a 401 or a 403: grant the permission or add an ability rule in
  `src/abilities.rs`.
- **Modules.** Services are `#[injectable]` structs whose `Arc<T>` fields
  are injected. A module lists them in `#[module(imports = [..],
  providers = [..], controllers = [..], exports = [..], register =
  Self::wire)]`; migrations, jobs, listeners, commands and templates are
  registered in `wire`. A module only sees its own providers, the exports of
  modules it imports, and global modules.
- **Input.** Request bodies are DTOs deriving `Deserialize` and
  `navree::validation::Validate`; every field has a `#[validate(..)]` rule or
  `#[validate(skip)]`. Handlers take `Valid(Json(input)): Valid<Json<T>>`
  (or `Valid<Query<T>>`), so invalid input never reaches them.
- **Errors.** Handlers return `Result<T>` (`navree::Result`, error type
  `AppError`): `AppError::not_found()`, `AppError::forbidden()`,
  `AppError::bad_request("..")`, `AppError::conflict("..")`. Any other
  error with `?` is a logged 500. Every error response has one JSON shape:

  ```json
  { "statusCode": 404, "message": "Not Found", "error": "Not Found", "code": "not_found" }
  ```

  `code` is the stable machine-readable code a front end maps to a
  translation key; give a refusal its own with
  `AppError::conflict("..").with_code("invoice_already_sent")`. Validation
  errors are 400s (`"code": "validation_failed"`) whose `message` lists
  every problem, plus `"errors": { "field": ["field should not be empty"] }`.
- **Database.** Tables are ORM models: `#[derive(Model)]` structs
  (`#[model(table = "posts", timestamps)]`) whose `id` is a UUID v7 the ORM
  generates, with `created_at` and `updated_at` it fills in. Services take
  the request's `&Uow` as a parameter; read with `Post::query()` and write
  with `Post::create(uow, Post { .. })`, `record.save(uow)` and
  `record.delete(uow)` (they record the changes for the audit log).
  Anything else, such as a hand-written statement, runs on the `&Uow` as an
  `Executor`. The unit of work commits when the response status is below
  400 and rolls back otherwise. Lists take `PageQuery`, return `Page<T>`
  (`{ "data", "meta" }`) and filter with `Accessible<Post, Read>`
  (`scope.query().paginate(uow, page)`). `navree check` requires every
  model to be classified: `m.global_entity::<Post>()` in its module's
  `wire` for one set of rows shared by every workspace (what the generators
  write), or `#[model(workspace)]` with a `workspace_id` column for rows
  that belong to one workspace.
- **Migrations** belong to their module's `MigrationSet`; never edit one
  that has run anywhere, add a new one.
- **Screens.** Pages are drawn on the server with `navree::ui`; there is no
  front-end project. A page is a handler that takes `Desk` (the shell, the
  signed-in account and the workspace) and returns an
  `AppPage` (see `src/modules/customers/pages.rs`); its route is a `RouteDef`
  marked `.authenticated()` and `.page()`, so a guest is sent to `/sign-in`
  and back. A form is a struct deriving `Validate` and `Form`, drawn by
  `FormView` and read by `Submit<T>`; a table is a struct deriving `TableRow`,
  drawn by `DataTable` (see `form.rs` and `table.rs`). Lists use the one list
  query: `search`, `filter[col][op]`, `sort`, `page` and `per_page`. Money is
  stored in paise and shown with `ui::format::rupees` (`₹1,00,000`).
- **Signing in.** `AuthPages` (registered in `src/app.rs`) draws the sign-in,
  two-factor, forgotten password and reset pages and answers `POST /sign-out`
  on the session cookie, with the throttle, two-factor authentication and the
  audit trail of `AuthModule`. Pages use `CurrentAccount` (or `Desk`) and
  never touch the cookie, the session or the password hasher.
- **Workspaces.** Customers belong to a workspace. A browser is in the
  workspace it last switched to (the switcher beside every page heading posts
  to `/workspace/switch`); read and write customers with
  `WorkspaceRepo::<Customer>` and the workspace id of the `Desk`.
- **Live updates.** After a change to data a screen shows, nudge the topic with
  `Live::nudge` once the unit of work commits (`uow.after_commit`), as
  `CustomerService` does; tables and figures that follow the stream
  (`stream().on(TOPIC)`) fetch themselves again. Only the members of the
  workspace the topic names hear it.
- **Demo data.** `src/modules/customers/seed.rs` (two demo workspaces) and the
  demo account in `auth.rs` are made at boot outside production. Do not rely on them in
  anything that runs in production.
- **TimescaleDB.** The database is TimescaleDB (PostgreSQL with
  time-series hypertables), started by `navree dock up`; tests run on
  SQLite, where the same migrations give regular tables. Make a table a
  hypertable when it is append-mostly, keyed by time and large (events,
  logs, metrics, history): `schema.create_hypertable("events",
  "occurred_at", |t| ..)` with a `uuid_primary()` key (UUID v7, so ids sort
  by time). Keep records that are updated in place or referenced by
  foreign keys (users, orders, settings) regular tables.
- **Drivers.** The app compiles only the `postgres` feature of `navree`;
  `[dev-dependencies]` turns `sqlite` on for the tests, so a release build
  compiles no SQLite.
- **Configuration.** `config/app.toml` holds shared settings; `.env` (this
  machine's settings and secrets) overrides it, and `APP_*` environment
  variables override both (`APP_DATABASE__URL` sets `database.url`). Set a
  key in one place. Never commit `.env` or put secrets in config/app.toml.
- **Tests.** Every change comes with tests. Module tests boot the module
  with `navree::testing::TestApp::builder().temp_database()`; call routes
  with `app.client()` (a guest) or `app.acting_as(principal(user_id))`,
  and assert with `assert_status`, `assert_json_path`, `assert_error` and
  `assert_validation_error`.

## Before you finish

Run `cargo fmt`, `cargo clippy --all-targets -- -D warnings` and
`cargo test`, and fix everything they report.

## Documentation and skills

- Docs: https://navree.com/docs/ (for models: https://navree.com/llms.txt,
  and every page as Markdown at `https://navree.com/docs/<section>/<page>.md`).
- Agent skills, one per common task (modules, routing, validation, the
  database, auth, access control, queues, tests and more):
  `navree skills:install` copies the skills of this Navree version into
  `.claude/skills/` and `.agents/skills/` (or use
  `npx skills add NavreeHQ/navree`). Start with the `navree` skill.
- Navigator (`navree mcp`, an MCP server over stdio) shows the running
  app: routes, the module graph and providers, the database schema,
  read-only SQL, the log file and the last error, the configuration, and
  the docs of this Navree version. Check routes, providers and the schema
  with it before changing them.
